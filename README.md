# DroneX
Drone x Flight Controller Simulator

### objective
***Learn ROS***

To Simulate a drone, And Implement its flight controller with PID control build from scratch.

### tasks
- **Phase 0**
  - Set up drones attributes: position, orientation, rotor speeds. 
  - Simulate the drones movement based on atributes.
  - Add controls.
- **Phase 1**
  - Set up basic PID control.
  - Distribute the PID control over 4 rotors.
  - Sync everything to make the flight controller.
- **Phase 2**
  - Shift the project to ROS.
