# DroneX
Drone x Flight Controller Simulator

### objective
***Learn ROS, Project Architecture and good Coding Habits***

### task
  ***simulate a drone, then move it from some random initial position and orientation to hovering state at target location via PID control.***  
- **Phase 0**
  - done ~~Set up the drone in C++: position, orientation, rotor speeds.~~
  - Simulate the drones movement based on attributes.
- **Phase 1**
  - Set up basic PID control.
  - Distribute the PID control over 4 rotors.
- **Phase 2**
  - Sync everything to make the flight controller.
  - Shift the project to ROS.
- **Bonus**
  - Implement AI and train it to tune the PID control to achieve the target state AFAP.
